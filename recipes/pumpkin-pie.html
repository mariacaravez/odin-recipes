    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        This is not your classic graham cracker pumpkin pie, and it is all made from scratch: none of that canned and pre-bought stuff!
        Don't worry, it'll still make you wanna curl up under a blanket on a cold autumn day. 
        The flakey crust takes an untraditional approach in just the right way,
        that it'll have you forgetting all about that graham cracker crust!
        No need to fret, however, it'll have you going back for another slice!
        It <em>will</em> have character, but with the right patience, you can get it to look perfectly homemade.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <h3>Crust</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cup + 4 Tbsp flour</li>
        <li>1 tsp salt</li>
        <li>2/3 cup of canola oil</li>
        <li>4 Tbsp ice water</li>
        <li>Wax or parchment paper</li>
        <li>Crust cover or foil paper</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Filling</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>1 sugar pumpkin</li>
        <li>2 eggs</li>
        <li>1 cup packed light brown sugar</li>
        <li>1 Tbsp all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp salt</li>
        <li>1 can (12 fluid ounce) evaporated milk</li>
        <li>2 1/2 teaspoons pumpkin pie spice</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Bake your pumpkin:
            <ul>
                <li>Preheat oven to 325 degrees Farenheit (165 degrees Celsius).</li>
                <li>Place aluminum foil on cookie sheet and grease.</li>
                <li>Cut pumpkin in half and remove seeds.</li>
                <li>Place pumpkin halves on baking sheet.</li>
                <li>Bake for 30 to 40 minutes or until flesh is tender when poked with fork. 
                    <strong>Tip: For gas ovens, it may take about 45 minutes.</strong>
                </li>
                <li>Flip pumpkin halves face up and allow to cool until just warm.</li>
                <strong>RAISE OVEN TEMPERATURE TO 450 DEGREES FARENHEIT (230 DEGREES CELSIUS)FOR FINAL BAKING.</strong>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            While pumpkin bakes, make the crust:
            <ul>
                <li>Combine flour and salt in a medium bowl.</li>
                <li>Add canola oil to flour mix and stir about 30 times.
                    <strong>Tip: DO NOT OVER MIX!</strong>
                </li>
                <li>Pour in your 4 tablespoons of ice water.</li>
                <li>Stir about 20 more times. 
                    <strong>Remember: Don't overwork it.</strong>
                </li>
                <li>Get two large sheets of parchment paper, big enough to cover your pie dish.</li>
                <li>Place your dough inbetween sheets and roll out with pin.</li>
                <li>Use your dish face down as a reference and ensure you have about an extra inch of dough all around.</li>
                <li>Remove top layer of parchment paper.</li>
                <li>Place pie dish face down on top of dough.</li>
                <li>Slip hand under bottom parchment paper and flip dough onto pie dish.
                    <strong>If crust crumbles or cracks, don't worry! Just patch things up together with your fingertip.</strong>
                </li>
                <li>Remove parchment paper and press dough into dish.</li>
                <li>Trim off any excess pieces or use them to patch up any gaps.
                    <strong>Tip: If you have any leftover dough, you can create cutout decorations for the edges or the center.</strong>
                </li>
                <li>Get creative here. There are many ways you can have your crust look beautiful, but I find that a simple pinch works with this crust the best. It is a very flaky crust, so it doesn't want to be overworked.</li>
                <li>Refrigerate your crust until ready to use.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <strong>Remember: Your oven should have been preheating to 450 degrees Farenheit (230 degrees Celsius) for final baking.</strong>
        <li>
            Make pumpkin puree:
            <ul>
                <li>When easy to handle, scoop out puree with spoon and place in blender or food processor and puree until smooth.</li>
                <li>Reserve 2 cups for filling. 
                    <strong>Tip: You can freeze any leftover puree for another time.</strong>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            Make your filling:
            <ul>
                <li>In a large bowl, slightly beat eggs.</li>
                <li>Stir in brown sugar.
                <li>Stir in flour and salt.</li>
                <li>Stir in 2 cups of pumpkin puree.</li>
                <li>Stir in pumpkin pie spice.</li>
                <li>Stir in evaporated milk. </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <strong>Oven should be preheated to 450 degrees Farenheit (230 degrees Celsius) at this point.</strong>
        <li>
            Bake your pie:
            <ul>
                <li>Pour mixture into your pie crust.</li>
                <li>Protect your crust with cover or foil paper.</li>
                <li>Bake for 10 minutes then reduce heat to 350 degrees Farenheit (175 degrees Celsius).</li>
                <li>Bake an additional 40-50 minutes or until a toothpick inserted comes out clean.
                    <strong>For gas ovens, it may take 1 hour.</strong>
                </li>
                <li>Remove foil paper 10 minutes before done to allow crust to brown.</li>
            </ul>
        <li>Allow to cool before you enjoy your pie! I prefer to refrigerate until completely cool (3-4 few hours) before cutting into it.</li>
    </ol>
